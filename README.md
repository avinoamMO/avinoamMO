### About

Former VP Operations & Product at a crypto PR distribution company that grew to $8M+ revenue and 329 media partners. Conceived the core algorithm that powered the business. Recognized as a Web3 expert by the national CPA Bureau, with 30+ institutional talks at banks, universities, and regulators. I combine full-stack engineering with business operations, product management, and compliance -- the rare profile that can build the product *and* run the company.
